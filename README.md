# Motion Activated Airhorn

This project consists of the 3D printed housing for an airhorn, an Arduino, a PIR motion sensor, and the relevant power supplies. This device is intended to scare anybody that walks into a room containing this automated airhorn. When the sensor detects heat in its surrounding environment from someone's body, the pin is set high on the sensor and the servo motor is rotated to a degree where it pushes on the top of the airhorn to make a loud noise.
